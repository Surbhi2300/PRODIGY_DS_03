**Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction**

This project builds and evaluates a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Using Python libraries such as pandas for data processing, scikit-learn for modeling, and matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, it handles data preparation, model training, and performance evaluation. The project includes visualizations of key metrics and the decision tree structure, helping businesses and analysts understand customer behavior and improve marketing strategies.
